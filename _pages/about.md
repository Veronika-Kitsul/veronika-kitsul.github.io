I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" class="underline">Princeton University</a>, concentrating in Electrical and Computer Engineering and pursuing minors in Chinese Language and Computer Science. 

In short, I'm most excited about hardware-software co-design and computer systems. Topics include: wireless communications, computer networking, distributed computing paradigms, kernel bypassing modules like eBPF, semiconductors and solid-state devices, computing architectures and data center technologies.

Outside academics, I love creating with my hands: anything from traditional Ukrainian beaded jewelry and crocheting to VGA graphics card built on digital logic chips (see my projects page for more!). In the summer, I enjoy hiking and long-distance running. 

🇺🇦 I’m originally from a small village in Western Ukraine, and my roots inspire my drive to learn, create, and make an impact.

大家好！我是苏若霓。我是普林斯顿大学的三年级的学生。我的专业是电气与计算机工程，辅修汉语和计算机科学。我来自乌克兰西部的一个小村庄。我不会用普通话说跟我的工作或者我的专业关系的事儿，可是我很喜欢了解中国的文化的问题。

我还有一个用普通话的视屏介绍乌克兰的首都-基辅。看一看我的“projects"。
